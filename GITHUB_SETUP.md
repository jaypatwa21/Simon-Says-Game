# GitHub Repository Setup Guide üöÄ

Follow these steps to create your GitHub repository and push your Simon Says game online!

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. **New Repository**: Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. **Repository Details**:
   - **Repository name**: `simon-says-game` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "A classic memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
   - **Visibility**: Choose "Public" (recommended for portfolio projects)
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
4. **Create Repository**: Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simon-says-game.git

# Rename the main branch to 'main' (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Add Screenshots (After Repository is Created)

1. **Play your game**: Open `index.html` in your browser
2. **Take screenshots** following the instructions in `screenshots/README.md`:
   - Game start screen
   - Game in progress
   - Button flash effect  
   - Game over screen
3. **Save screenshots** in the `screenshots/` folder
4. **Update README.md** with screenshot links
5. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add screenshots/
   git commit -m "Add game screenshots"
   git push
   ```

## Step 4: Update README with Screenshots

Add this section to your main README.md after taking screenshots:

```markdown
## üì∏ Screenshots

### Game Start Screen
![Game Start](screenshots/game-start.png)

### Game in Progress
![Game Playing](screenshots/game-playing.png)

### Button Flash Effect
![Button Flash](screenshots/button-flash.png)

### Game Over Screen
![Game Over](screenshots/game-over.png)
```

## Step 5: Update Repository URL in README

Don't forget to update the clone URL in your README.md from:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simon-says-game.git
```
to:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ACTUAL_USERNAME/simon-says-game.git
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
- Use personal access token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys for GitHub

### If remote already exists:
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simon-says-game.git
```

### To check your remote:
```bash
git remote -v
```

## üéâ After Setup

Once everything is pushed to GitHub:
1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Deploy from branch ‚Üí main)
2. **Share your game** - it will be available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/simon-says-game`
3. **Add the live link** to your repository description
